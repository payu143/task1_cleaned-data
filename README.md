# Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning a CSV dataset. It involves handling missing values, fixing data format issues, and preparing the data for Machine Learning models.

## Project Overview

- Raw data: `raw_data.csv`
- Cleaned data: `cleaned_data.csv`
- Code file: `data_cleaning.ipynb`

## Key Steps

- Handling missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Fixed incorrect data types
- Identified and removed outliers
- Encoded categorical variables
- Applied feature scaling
- Finalized clean dataset for ML

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to clean messy and incomplete data so that it becomes usable for machine learning. This ensures models can be trained effectively without data errors.
